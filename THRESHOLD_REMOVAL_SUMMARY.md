# Threshold Optimization Removal Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **run_comparative_analysis.py**
- Removed all threshold optimization code
- Simplified to only use default 0.5 thresholds
- Updated biological metrics references from `optimal_thresholds` to `metrics`
- Fixed quick summary to use `metrics` instead of `optimal_thresholds`

### 2. **create_kdd_visualizations.py**
- Updated radar chart to use `metrics` instead of `optimal_thresholds`

### 3. **learn_hallmark_associations.py**
- Fixed typo: `dateset` → `dataset`
- Updated `load_cached_dataset` to properly load from individual cache files with index.json
- Added `_reconstruct_graph` method to deserialize NetworkX graphs
- Added proper handling for list-type labels

### 4. **run_mechanistic_interpretability_learned.py**
- Fixed cache path: `self.config['data']['cache_dir']` → `self.config['dataset']['cache_dir']`
- Updated to load from proper cache structure with index.json
- Added `_reconstruct_graph` method to deserialize NetworkX graphs

## Key Insights

1. **Threshold optimization often hurts performance** because:
   - It overfits to validation set
   - Per-class optimization doesn't align with overall metrics
   - Models are already well-calibrated with 0.5 thresholds

2. **Cached data structure**:
   - Data is cached in `cache/kg_preprocessed/{split}/` directories
   - Each split has an `index.json` file listing all samples
   - Individual samples are stored as pickle files
   - Knowledge graphs are serialized as node/edge lists

3. **Data-driven associations are better** than hardcoded biological knowledge:
   - Learn from actual training data statistics
   - Adapt to dataset characteristics
   - Provide statistical confidence measures
